Here’s a basic `README.md` for your GitHub repository. Since your project uses both Node.js and React, I’ve created sections for both the frontend and backend, along with setup instructions for both. You can customize it as needed based on your specific project setup.

# React Food Project

This project is a food ordering app built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend. It allows users to browse through different meals, add them to the cart, and place an order.

## Live Demo

You can check out the live demo of the project here:  
[React Food Project Live Demo](https://sahar-ch.github.io/React-Food-Project/)

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite for fast builds, and CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express to serve API endpoints for meals and order data.
- **Static Assets**: Served via Express static middleware to display images and other resources.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below for both the **frontend** and **backend**.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

---

## Frontend Setup (React)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sahar-ch/React-Food-Project.git
   cd React-Food-Project
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the React app in development mode and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Express server, and the API will be available for interacting with your app. By default, the server will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Usage

### Frontend

- The React app is responsible for displaying the UI, handling interactions, and sending requests to the backend API.
- The app is built using **React** and **Vite** for fast builds and hot module replacement.

### Backend

- The Node.js server handles API requests like fetching meals, adding orders, etc.
- It serves static files like images, which are placed in the `public` directory.

---

## Deployment

You can deploy both the frontend and backend to production using platforms like [Render](https://render.com) for the backend and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the frontend.

### Frontend Deployment:

1. Build the React app for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `build` folder to GitHub Pages using the following command (ensure you're inside the `client` folder):
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Backend Deployment:

1. Deploy the backend using Render or another cloud platform.
   - Push your backend code to GitHub.
   - Set up your backend service on Render or another platform that supports Node.js.
   - Make sure the API is available at a publicly accessible URL.
